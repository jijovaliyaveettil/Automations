# Automation
These are some just basic automation programs that I have done to make some tasks easier in my day to day life. These codes are raw and i just worked on them while learning frameworks such as selenium and BeautifulSoup.

Something to work on in the Future:

For Price Monitoring:
- Add Email Alerts
- Create Graph Price Trends for better comparison

For Sports News scraping:
- Create classification of columns
